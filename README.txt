README - Online Course Registration System UI Demo

Team Member Contributions
- Name 1: Built Home Screen (index.html) and helped with styles.css
- Name 2: Built Course Search Screen (course-search.html)
- Name 3: Built Student Registration Screen (student-registration.html) and app.js validation
- Name 4: Built Instructor Schedule and Session Enrollment screens

One-line Summary of Each Screen
- Home: Provides navigation to all system features.
- Course Search: Allows searching courses by department/instructor/course number and shows course details.
- Student Registration: Lets students view enrolled sessions and register with validation for duplicates and enrollment limits.
- Instructor Schedule: Lets instructors view assigned sessions.
- Session Enrollment: Shows students enrolled in a selected session for authorized users.

HTML/CSS/JS Used
- HTML: forms, tables, buttons, navigation links
- CSS: shared stylesheet for consistent layout, colors, fonts, buttons, and tables
- JS: registration validation (no duplicate registrations, no registration if session is full), simple table filtering for course search

Design Decisions / Challenges
- Used one shared header/nav and one shared CSS file to ensure consistent look and feel.
- Kept functionality front-end only with sample data since this is a UI/UX draft.
- Time constraints required focusing on core features first.
- Prioritized simple, intuitive navigation to reduce user confusion and ensure the interface is easy to use without instructions.
